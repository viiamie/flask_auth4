### Description
This is a web application that allows users to register/login/logout and make posts about their favorite movies. Users can add, edit, view, and delete movies that they upload but can not perform these functions on movies uploaded by other users that can be seen on the browse movies page. They are asked to input the movie title, a description of the movie, and what they would rate the movie from a scale of 1-5. Admin privledges allow for user and movie management which includes add, edit, view, and delete.
